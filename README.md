| Mobile Application              | A mobile application allows **clients and assistants** to interact with the system on the go, enhancing **availability** by ensuring access anywhere and anytime, even when they are away from a desktop.<br><br>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | CON-1, CON-3, <br>QA-1         |
| Rich Internet Application (RIA) | Provides a more interactive and responsive experience than traditional web apps, with reduced dependency on the server. RIAs can be easily updated because the logic and interface are managed centrally on the server, but the rich client-side interactivity allows for a smoother experience. Modifications on the client side can be done independently of the server-side changes, improving **modifiability**. Once loaded, an RIA can work with minimal server communication, improving the performance and responsiveness of the application. | CON-2, QA-6, QA-3              |
| Service Application             | A service application (API Layer) encapsulates core functionality and ensures **reliability** through modular design. This separation reduces the chance of failure in one part affecting the whole system. It supports **scalability** and **reuse** of services for multiple clients like mobile, web, and CLI. It does not provide a user interface but rather expose services that are consumed by other applications.                                                                                                                            | CON-1, CON-3, QA-9             |
| 3 tier                          | Provides a simple, well-established separation of concerns between presentation, business logic, and data layers, which enhances **reliability**, **scalability**, **maintainability**, and cost-effectiveness without introducing unnecessary complexity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | CON-1, CON-3, QA-9, QA-3, QA-6 |

| Web Application | Typically, web applications are less interactive and rely heavily on page reloads for updates, which can make the user experience feel slower and less responsive. Standard web apps can suffer from performance issues, particularly when dealing with high-frequency updates or large amounts of data. Each user interaction may require a round-trip to the server, leading to latency and slower user experience. |
| 4 tier          | Introduces an additional layer that increases operational complexity and overhead, suitable for complex systems with advanced routing, traffic management, or microservices needs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

It has a strong ecosystem with **ASP.NET Core**, which offers robust support for building REST APIs and can handle high numbers of concurrent connections. **C#** supports **asynchronous programming** for high scalability and **reliability** (QA-10) by enabling the application to handle multiple requests without blocking threads.  <br>Additionally, the **.NET** ecosystem provides excellent tooling for continuous integration and testing, improving **modifiability** (QA-3).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Use a relational database                                                            | A relational database is selected due to its ability to enforce **data consistency** and its **maturity** in handling complex queries. Relational databases (RDBMS) ensure **data integrity**, and they are well-suited for structured data where relationships between tables are critical. They also offer **transactional support** to handle large amounts of data reliably. The database choice supports **QA-9** (reliability) by ensuring that the application maintains data consistency even in the face of failures.  <br>  <br>Discarded alternatives:  <br>- **NoSQL databases**: While NoSQL databases provide flexibility, they lack the strict consistency guarantees and transactional support required by the system, which could lead to data inconsistency in critical business processes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Use Docker containers for deployment                                                 | Because the application has to be moved across environments (QA-7), deploying the application as a set of container images is preferred.<br><br>Virtual Machines are discarded because they are considerably larger than container images and requires more resources  than containers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Define and expose REST APIs to the front-end and document them using Swagger/OpenAPI | REST APIs are chosen to facilitate communication between the front-end and the back-end. These APIs provide a standardized way for the front-end (Angular, Swift, or Android clients) to interact with the business logic and data layers. The use of **Swagger/OpenAPI** ensures that these APIs are well-documented and easily understandable by both developers and automated tools.<br><br>The documentation provides clarity and reduces ambiguity during development, contributing to better **modifiability** (QA-3) and **interoperability** (QA-7). Additionally, it helps improve **testability** (QA-7) by enabling automated API tests.<br><br>**Discarded alternatives:** SOAP: While SOAP provides a more rigid protocol for communication, it is less flexible and has more overhead than RESTful APIs. GraphQL: While GraphQL offers fine-grained data fetching, it can lead to more complex queries and requires more effort to implement and maintain. This would increase development time and complexity, which is not necessary for the current system. |
| Use TLS (HTTPs) to encrypt data in transit                                           | TLS (Transport Layer Security) is selected to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of data exchanged between the front-end and back-end, as well as any communication with external systems. By encrypting data in transit, TLS prevents man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks and eavesdropping on sensitive information, such as user credentials or payment details. This choice supports **Security** (QA-2) and ensures compliance with industry standards for data protection.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Encrypt confidential data in database with symmetric encryption                      | Confidential data, such as user passwords, financial records, and other personally identifiable information, is encrypted within the database to protect it in the event of a data breach. Using encryption ensures that even if unauthorized access occurs, sensitive data remains unreadable. This supports **Security** (QA-2).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

### Iteration 2: Identifying Structures to Support Primary Functionality



#### Step 2. Establish Iteration Goal by Selecting Drivers

In this iteration, the design focuses on the back-end of the application. The goal is to identify structures that support primary functionality. The first use cases considered are:
* CE-1 Register client
* CB-1 Assign availability time slot
* CC-1 Register assistant
* CD-1 Register service
Since these use case and its modules are CRUD-based and share related behavior, I chose to apply domain decomposition to create components and accommodate the functionality within the architecture. This approach follows the reference method describe by John Chessman in "A Simple Process for Specifying Component-Based Software".

#### Step 3. Choose Elements of the System to Refine

In this iteration, the elements to be refined are the modules located across the different layers defined by the two reference architectures established in the previous iteration. The functionality needed to support the system’s use cases will require the collaboration of components located in these different layers, ensuring they work together to provide the necessary services.
#### Step 4. Choose Design Concepts That Satisfy the Selected Drivers

The following table summarizes the design decisions.

| Design Decision and Location                             | Rational and Assumptions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Select Domain-Decomposition for Component-Based Software | Domain decomposition is selected as the primary approach for defining the system’s components because the core functionality is centered around CRUD operations that share related business behavior. By organizing components based on business domains, each module can encapsulate related logic, making the system more maintainable and scalable. This also enables better isolation of concerns, allowing each domain to evolve independently while still maintaining clear boundaries between the components. Domain decomposition provides a natural mapping to the system’s use cases. |
